## packages needed
  1. opencv
  2. numpy
  3. pillow

## There are three steps for face recognition:
  1. Collecting face data (your face pictures) and labels and save to dataset folder. (code 1)
  2. Input face data and labels into model to train a recognition model. (code 2)
  3. Open up your webcam to start real time face recognition. (code 3)

## Instructions:

  When finish taking pictures, "[INFO] Exiting Program and cleanup stuff" pops up.
  
  (3.5. Run the first code again, enter number '2' (for second person), follow the same procedure.) 

  4. Run the second code, just wait several seconds to train the model.
  
  5. Run the third code, it will open your camera and start real time face recognition.
  
  ## 6. enjoy!
